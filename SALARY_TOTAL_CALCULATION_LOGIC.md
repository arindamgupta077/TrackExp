# Enhanced "Total" Column Logic in Monthly Remaining Balances Table

## Overview

The "Total" column in the Monthly Remaining Balances table now includes an additional trigger for calculation when monthly salary is added. This ensures that months with salary are included in the total calculation, even if they are in the future.

## Current Logic (Before Enhancement)

The "Total" column was calculated as:
- **Historical Years (2025 to Previous Year)**: All 12 months for each year
- **Current Year**: January to current month only

## Enhanced Logic (After Enhancement)

The "Total" column now includes:
1. **Historical Years (2025 to Previous Year)**: All 12 months for each year
2. **Current Year**: January to current month only
3. **NEW: Salary Months**: Any month where salary has been added (even future months)

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Schema

#### New Table: `salary_months_tracking`
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.salary_months_tracking (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  year INTEGER NOT NULL,
  month INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (month >= 1 AND month <= 12),
  salary_added_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now(),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now(),
  UNIQUE(user_id, year, month)
);
```

#### New Functions:
- `mark_salary_month_added(user_id, year, month)`: Marks a month as having salary added
- `has_salary_for_month(user_id, year, month)`: Checks if a month has salary
- `get_salary_months_for_user(user_id)`: Gets all salary months for a user

### 2. Frontend Implementation

#### New Hook: `useSalaryMonthsTracking`
- Manages salary months tracking state
- Provides functions to mark and check salary months
- Returns a Set for quick lookup of salary months

#### Enhanced Hook: `useMonthlyRemainingBalances`
- Updated `getAccumulatedTotalForCategory` function
- Now includes months with salary in the total calculation
- Prevents double-counting of months

#### Updated Salary Addition Logic
- When salary is added via "Add Monthly Salary" modal
- Automatically marks the month in `salary_months_tracking` table
- Ensures the month is included in future total calculations

## Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New Month Arrives
**Date**: October 1st, 2025
**Action**: New month (October) becomes current month
**Result**: "Total" column automatically includes October 2025's category remaining balance

### Scenario 2: Salary Added for Future Month
**Date**: September 28th, 2025
**Action**: User adds salary for October 2025 via "Add Monthly Salary" modal
**Result**: "Total" column immediately includes October 2025's category remaining balance

### Scenario 3: Both Events Occur
**Date**: September 28th, 2025 (salary added) â†’ October 1st, 2025 (new month)
**Result**: October 2025 is NOT double-counted in the total calculation

## Key Features

### 1. No Double Counting
The system ensures that each month is only counted once in the total calculation, regardless of how many triggers occur.

### 2. Future Month Support
Months with salary are included in the total even if they are in the future, providing immediate visibility of budget impact.

### 3. Automatic Tracking
When salary is added through the modal, the month is automatically marked without user intervention.

### 4. Consistent Calculation
The total calculation remains consistent regardless of the selected year filter in the UI.

## Files Modified

### Database Files
- `create_salary_months_tracking_table.sql`: New table creation
- `mark_salary_month_function.sql`: New functions for salary month tracking

### Frontend Files
- `src/hooks/useSalaryMonthsTracking.ts`: New hook for salary months management
- `src/hooks/useMonthlyRemainingBalances.ts`: Enhanced total calculation logic
- `src/pages/Index.tsx`: Updated salary addition logic

## Usage

### For Developers
1. Run the SQL files in Supabase Dashboard > SQL Editor
2. The new logic is automatically active once the database changes are applied
3. No additional configuration required

### For Users
1. Add salary via "Add Monthly Salary" modal as usual
2. The month is automatically included in the "Total" calculation
3. View the updated totals in the Monthly Remaining Balances table

## Benefits

1. **Immediate Impact**: Users can see the effect of adding salary for future months
2. **Better Planning**: Total calculations include all months with income
3. **Consistency**: Same month is never counted twice
4. **Transparency**: Clear visibility of which months contribute to the total
5. **Flexibility**: Works with both current and future month salary additions

## Technical Notes

- The system uses a Set data structure for O(1) lookup of salary months
- Database constraints ensure data integrity
- Row Level Security (RLS) is enabled for all new tables
- The implementation is backward compatible with existing data
