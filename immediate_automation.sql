-- IMMEDIATE AUTOMATION SOLUTION
-- =====================================================

-- This is the simplest possible solution that works immediately

-- =====================================================
-- OPTION 1: Manual Daily Processing (Works Now)
-- =====================================================

-- Run this query daily to process recurring expenses:
-- SELECT * FROM manual_trigger_recurring_expenses();

-- =====================================================
-- OPTION 2: Create a Simple Function
-- =====================================================

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION daily_expense_processing()
RETURNS TEXT AS $$
DECLARE
    result RECORD;
BEGIN
    -- Use the existing manual trigger function
    SELECT * INTO result FROM manual_trigger_recurring_expenses();
    
    RETURN result.message;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

-- =====================================================
-- OPTION 3: Test Everything
-- =====================================================

-- Test the simple function
SELECT 'Testing daily processing...' as status;
SELECT daily_expense_processing();

-- =====================================================
-- OPTION 4: Show What You Have
-- =====================================================

-- Show your recurring expenses
