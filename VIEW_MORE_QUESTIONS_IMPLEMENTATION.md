## 🚀 Implementation Details

### **State Management**
```typescript
const [showAllQuestions, setShowAllQuestions] = useState(false);
```

### **Dynamic Question Rendering**
```typescript
{suggestedQuestions.slice(0, showAllQuestions ? suggestedQuestions.length : (isMobile ? 4 : 6)).map((question, index) => (
  // Question buttons
))}
```

### **Smart Button Logic**
```typescript
{showAllQuestions ? (
  <>
    <ChevronDown className="h-3 w-3" />
    Show Less Questions
  </>
) : (
  <>
    <ChevronRight className="h-3 w-3" />
    View More Questions ({suggestedQuestions.length - (isMobile ? 4 : 6)} more)
  </>
)}
```
